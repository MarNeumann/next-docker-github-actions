# Next-Docker-Github-Actions

## What is this?
This is a sample repo for desting continuous deployment of a Next.js app to a VPS (Hetzner in this case, but could be any) using GitHub Actions

It exists for two reasons:
1. Figuring out how this works
2. As a reference for me to work from in the future

## What did I learn from this?
- tbc... not done yet!
